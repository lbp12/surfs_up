# Surfs Up
## Overview
In this module I looked at temperature trends in Oahu to open up a surf and ice cream shop. This analysis specifically looked at temperature in June and December to see if the shop would be sustainable year round.

## Results
After looking at June and December's summary of statistics I found: <br/>
- The average temperature for June is about 75 degrees compared to 71 degress for December. 
- The temperatures do vary more in December however, with the lowest being 56 and the highest being 83.
- June's temperatures are less varying than December but still can have a 20 degree difference with the lowest being 64 and the highest being 85.<br/>

## Summary
Although the temperatures vary more in December the average is within 4 degrees of June. This would still provide appropriate weather for the surf and ice cream shop.<br/>
I would also look at the precipitation for both June and December. <br/>

December's average amount of precipitation is 0.08 higher than June's average. This would still be optimal for keeping the surf and ice cream shop open year round.
